                <h2>The Road to Enlightenment</h2>
                <p>
                    Littering a dark and dreary road lay the past relics of browser-specific tags, 
                    incompatible DOMs, broken CSS support, and abandoned browsers. <br><br>

                    We must clear the mind of the past. Web enlightenment has been achieved thanks 
                    to the tireless efforts of folk like the W3C, WaSP, and the major browser creators. <br><br>

                    The CSS Zen Garden invites you to relax and meditate on the  important lessons of 
                    the masters. Begin to see with clarity. Learn to  use the time-honored techniques 
                    in new and invigorating fashion. Become  one with the web.

                    Strong visual design has always been our focus. You are modifying this page, so 
                    strong CSS skills are necessary too, but the example files are commented well enough 
                    that even CSS novices can use them as starting points. Please see the <a href="#">CSS Resource 
                    Guide</a> for advanced tutorials and tips on working with CSS. <br><br>

                    You may modify the style sheet in any way you wish, but not the HTML. This may seem 
                    daunting at first if you’ve never worked this way before, but follow the listed links to 
                    learn more, and use the sample files as a guide. <br><br>

                    Download the sample <a href="#">HTML</a> and <a href="#">CSS</a> to work on a copy locally. Once you have completed 
                    your masterpiece (and please, don’t submit half-finished work) upload your CSS file to 
                    a web server under your control. <a href="#">Send us a link</a> to an archive of that file and all 
                    associated assets, and if we choose  to use it we will download it and place it on 
                    our server.

                <h2>Requirements</h2>
                <p>
                    Where possible, we would like to see mostly CSS 1 & 2 usage. CSS 3 & 4 
                    should be limited to widely-supported elements only, or strong  fallbacks 
                    should be provided. The CSS Zen Garden is about functional,  practical 
                    CSS and not the latest bleeding-edge tricks viewable by 2% of the browsing 
                    public. The only real requirement we have is that your CSS validates. <br><br>

                    Luckily, designing this way shows how well various browsers have implemented 
                    CSS by now. When sticking to the guidelines you should see fairly  consistent 
                    results across most modern browsers. Due to the sheer number  of user agents 
                    on the web these days — especially when you factor in  mobile — pixel-perfect 
                    layouts may not be possible across every  platform. That’s okay, but do test 
                    in as many as you can. Your design  should work in at least IE9+ and the latest 
                    Chrome, Firefox, iOS and  Android browsers (run by over 90% of the population). <br><br>

                    We ask that you submit original artwork. Please respect copyright laws. Please 
                    keep objectionable material to a minimum, and try to  incorporate unique and 
                    interesting visual themes to your work. We’re  well past the point of needing 
                    another garden-related design. <br><br>

                    This is a learning exercise as well as a demonstration. You retain full 
                    copyright on your graphics (with limited exceptions, see <a href="#">submission guidelines</a>), 
                    but we ask you release your CSS under a Creative Commons license identical to 
                    the one <a href="#">on this site</a> so that others may learn from your work. <br><br>
